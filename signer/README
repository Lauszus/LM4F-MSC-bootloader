Crypto-signing the firmware
===========================

* Generate your keypair with key-generate
  - will ask for password 3 times
* Copy your firmware (firmware.bin) here
* Run key-sign to sign the firmware
  - will create firmware.sig which is the signed firmware - see below
* Verify the signature with key-verify
* Run key-export which will generate ../rsa_key.c source file needed to build
  crypto-enabled bootloader.

Format of firmware.sig
----------------------

File consists of 3 parts:
- header    (16 bytes)
- code      (variable length)
- signature (512 bytes)

Header:

   offset   | len | meaning
------------+-----+--------------------------------
 0x00  =  0 |  2  | magic (0x5A 0x2D = "Z-")
 0x02  =  2 |  4  | code size
 0x06  =  6 |  2  | signature size (should be 512)
 0x08  =  8 |  8  | reserved for future use
